     		<h2>A simple yet useful options panel</h2>
     			<p>While keeping the theme minimal Charlene does boast it's own custom options to make procedures like adding your Google analytics code to the footer file a breeze for anyone. Nothing fancy, all Charlene tries to do is keep the set up of your site as minimal as the look of the theme itself.</p>
     			
     			<p>Theme options are split into five sections at the moment for organizational purposes: General, Header, Front Page and Footer. For a complete look at the available options please visit <a href="http://papertreedesign.com/themes/theme-admin-panel/">http://papertreedesign.com/themes/theme-admin-panel/</a></p>
     
     		<h2>Other useful things to note</h2>
     			<h3>Widget areas:</h3>
     				<ul>
     					<li><strong>Sidebar Main</strong> <p>Main sidebar widget area.</p></li>
     					<li><strong>Sidebar Secondary</strong> <p>Loaded after the main sidebar, especially useful if you decide to split and go with two sidebars.</p></li>
     					<li><strong>After Post</strong> <p>Widget ready area for after post plugins and functions that are packaged with widgets. Would be useful for recent posts or perhaps a text area that links to your available Rss subscriptions.</p></li>
     				</ul>
     				
     			<h3>SEO</h3>
     				<p>A few special extras have been added to Charlene to improve overall site SEO. However if you choose to use plugins such as All-In-One-SEO Pack you can easily switch off the built in SEO functions so that you are not repeating yourself.</p>
     				
     			<h3>Current State of Support</h3>
     				<p>I am aiming to provide the best support possible, as of right now you are welcome to drop an email to themesupport@papertreedesign.com. Please know that I will get back to you as soon as possible although not immediately. I welcome your comments, ideas and concerns.</p>
     				
     			<h3>Growing Documentation</h3>
     				<p>Theme Demo, Documentation, Tips, Tricks and Tutorials are available at <a href="http://papertreedesign.com/themes/">Papertree Themes</a> This documentation will continue to grow as time goes on, I encourage you to add your thoughts and questions wherever appropriate.</p>
     				
     			<h3>Credit Is Due</h3>
     				<p>Charlene is a theme based on something that I had created in the past for a personal WordPress site on which received some good feedback and even requests for theme release. This revamped version is built on a theme framework I assembled for my own personal/business use. I contemplated whether it was necessary to include all of the features of that framework in a publicly released theme and after some thought decided to go ahead with it as they may be useful to some.</p>
     				<p>Would not be fair of me to leave out mention a few of the places from which I have learned and received inspiration along the way. <a href="http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/">The Sandbox Theme</a>, the originals by <a href="http://www.briangardner.com/">Brian Gardner</a>, Thematic by Ian Stewart, <a href="http://themehybrid.com">Hybrid</a> by Justin Tadlock, <a href="http://diythemes.com">Thesis</a> by Chris Pearson, WordPress and of course the Kubrick Theme. Many more but you get the idea.</p>
     				
     			<h3>License &amp; Copyright</h3>
     				<p>You are welcome to remove the link back to Charlene in the footer, in fact it has been made rather easy, but we always appreciate if you decide to link back to the theme pages or Papertree Design in some way, shape or form.</p>
